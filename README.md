# MACU-Net: Semantic Segmentation from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images 

In this repository, we incorporate multi-scale features generated by different layers of U-Net and design a multi-scale skip connected and asymmetric-convolution-based U-Net (MACU-Net), for segmentation using fine-resolution remotely sensed images. 

The detailed results can be seen in the [MACU-Net Semantic Segmentation from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2007/2007.13083.pdf).
